## üòé **Quick start**

<br>

First, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install **Python**. Version `3.7` or higher is recommended.


Let's now install our dependencies **required modules** using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, make sure you are in the root directory of this project and then just run the `Main.py` python file

```bash
python Main.py
```

That's all you need to know to start! ‚úÖ

## üê£ **Notes**

<br>

This is a very simplified version of a terminal, some commands might run smoothly, some others might not.

##  **Built with**

<br>


- [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_reference.asp) - Python is a popular programming language used in many fields.

- [PyQt5](https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial) - PyQt is a library that lets you use the Qt GUI framework from Python. Qt itself is written in C++. By using it from Python, you can build applications much more quickly while not sacrificing much of the speed of C++.
